# FeelingBlue: A Corpus for Understanding the Emotional Connotation of Color in Context

![FeelingBlue](fixtures/corpus_sample.png)
Representative examples spanning **FeelingBlue**'s emotion subsets. Each image in an emotion subset has a score between -1 and 1 derived from its Best-Worst Scaling annotations.  Images selected as the _least_/_most_ emotional in a 4-tuple (not shown here) have rationales explaining why they are _less_/_more_ emotional than the rest. The names and creators of these works can be found [here](https://github.com/amith-ananthram/feelingblue/blob/main/fixtures/corpus_sample_artists.txt).
